about
----------

a template that includes:
* django
* postgres db
* nginx & gunicorn
* all on docker containers

Eventually could split branches for different dbs (maria, mysql, etc.) and even other variations on the setup (Vue.js etc.)


usage
----------

dev:
`docker-compose up --build`

prod:
`docker-compose --file docker-compose.prod.yml up --build`

thoughts
-------------

* cloning & using the template:
	* could clone the rope, checkout -b whatever variations I want to start with
	* then the new project could git remote rm <old remote> * put in place a new remote, which would be the repo for the new project going forward
* maybe a fork could also work:
	* to start a new proj, I fork the repo
	* create a new branch
	* any modifs to the original templat (improvements & tweaks) would be made on the initial branch I pull. Then I just PR that
	* return to the working branch to actually work on the project
	* eventually create a new repo & change the remote
