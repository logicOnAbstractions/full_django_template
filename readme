about
----------

a template that includes:
* django
* postgres db
* nginx & gunicorn
* all on docker containers

Eventually could split branches for different dbs (maria, mysql, etc.) and even other variations on the setup (Vue.js etc.)

thoughts
-------------

* to work with this, a few ideas:
	* could clone the rope, checkout -b whatever variations I want to start with
	* then the new project could git remote rm <old remote> * put in place a new remote, which would be the repo for the new project going forward
